# Data Collection and Processing

The original source of the data for this project is Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, but we are planning on getting the data from Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan as they have compiled and processed the data into an easier format for us to manipulate for this project. The link for this data is: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/38795. The data includes the state, month, police agency, and offense code of each arrest. Additionally, most of the observations include demographic information for the people involved in the arrest such as their age, gender, and ethnicity. This dataset is appropriate for this topic because it contains the data drawn from the Uniform Crime Report's Return A form that is published by the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) which police agencies (voluntarily) fill out and return every month. This form contains information on the number of arrests for each offense and demographic information from that agency. 

An additional dataset we inclluded was the US states population breakdown, including information about race. This was needed to fairly compare the rates of marijuana arrest by race. Thiss data allowed us to normalize the arrest counts against the population size of each racial group studied within each state. Without this, we would have been simplpy comparing the raw counts of arrests based on race, and would not have been accounting for the difference in the population size of each group which would probably create misleading visualizations and conclusions

One common data processing decision was excluding the n/a or no information given cases. We did this initially by filtering out cases where there was no race, ethnicity, or sex information filed and then further when looking at a specific offense
