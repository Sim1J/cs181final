In particular, we looked at how the arrest rate for possession of marijuana varied for  different reported races as well as _______. These topics are important because they shine light on significant social issues in the justice system and display that there may be racial disparities in the US incarcaration rates. \n",

        "The arrest data is from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program in 2021, which allows police agencies to report their arrest information every month. This form contains information on the number of arrests for each offense and demographic information from that agency. This dataset, thus, will give us the demographic information that we need to be able to analyze if there are any disparities or trends amongst the groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the population data comes from the  U.S. Census Bureau and contains breakdowns by state of the total population and the population by similar race categories to that of the UCR reporting.\n"

In some states, Black individuals are arrested for marijuana possession at a rate almost 10 times higher than white individuals, such as in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. This supports the claim from before that there is a racial disparity in the arrest rates because the data is normalized to each demographic's population with eaach state, showing arrests per 100,000 individuals within each group.\n",
